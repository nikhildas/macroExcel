I was always excited to do something creative..but never knew that it would end up in this..
As someone said...."Happiness is Handmade..."
And now... I would love to say that this is wat which make my day.. :)
________________________________________________________________________________________________
When people talk about silver lining, I never got what they had to do with our life. 
Hope? I dont know. But when I get on my bike and I see straight road, 
I wonder where will it be leading me, thats where my hope lies. 
When I gently press the start, the engine roars and ask me, 
"Where do u wanna go today?". 
I dont know, jst go.
Is it about how far you can go, or how fast you can go. 
Is it for the smell of the burning rubber or just for the peace of mind.

It is about skipping you heart beat, 
forgetting to breath, 
to embrace the wind. 
We keep on shifting the gear, 
hoping like if there was one more. 
Its about becoming one with the ride. 
It was never about the ride you choose to drive. 
its about the ride you choose to ride. 
In to the wind.

When people talk about silver lining, I never got (knew or got to know) what they had to do with our life (lives). 
Hope? I dont know. But when I get on my bike and I see straight road (the road ahead), 
I wonder where will it be leading me, + (perhaps) that’s where my hope lies. 
When I gently press the start, the engine roars and ask me, 
"Where do u wanna go today?”(“where shall we go today..?” – becz its about u n your bike..not just about u). 
I dont know, jst go.
Is it about how far you can go(it could be), or how fast you can go(it could be).
